My last README still applies mostly except for bug fixes I was able to do.

Taking a Survey/Test
MP: Multiple choice is straight forward, simply answer the number corresponding to the answer you wish to choose.

Ranking: Ranking is also straight forward. Simply enter each rank in as instructed.

Matching: Rather than the original idea of the user entering the left column entry and right column entry, the user only enters the right.
	  The program will prompt the user to match specific left elements. This makes grading/tabulating simpler and reduces possible bad input.

The rest are the same as before prompts indicating multiple parts for SA questions will have multiple responses.


One other tiny quirk in my program is when you are creating a MP question if you enter a null input it handles it, however 
after resetting and having you redo the choices, it then makes you do the remaining choices after the null input.
It throws this away and only keeps the good input, but it is a wierd quirk I need to look into.

Sample Files are included.

swSS
swSSfilled is a survey with some responses saved

same goes for swTT and swTTfilled these are simply test versions.
for swTTfilled the two tests are under names 'Bob' and 'Wrong'.
